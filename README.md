I joined GitHub on 16 February 2018, making a total of 5277 commits and contributing to 32 repositories (excluding my own).

You can find me in the Fediverse at [@allanchain@venera.social](https://venera.social/profile/allanchain), or explore my academic publications via [0000-0001-6980-163X](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6980-163X). My current research focuses on developing neural network approaches to solve SchrÃ¶dinger equations in condensed matter systems â€“ where machine learning meets quantum mechanics.

As a Python-centric developer, I leverage its ecosystem for both scientific computing and personal projects, while using JavaScript/TypeScript to build web interfaces and extensions for popular tools. ðŸ‘‡
